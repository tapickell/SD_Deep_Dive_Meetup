### Topcis Discussed
- Javascript
  - The Bad Parts
    - Only somewhat Functional
      - Mutating state is bad and most of the Array prototype functions do it
    - Not really Object Oriented
      - Prototypal Oriented Programming 🤷‍♂️
  - Why Then???
    - It's invaded all the browsers😱
  - Solutions?
    - Burn it with fire? 🔥
    - Everything else compiles to Javascript
      - [Elixir](https://github.com/elixirscript/elixirscript)
      - [Ruby](https://github.com/opal/opal)
      - [OCaml](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript)
      - [Clojure](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
    - Alternatives languages that compile to Javascript
      - [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) JS with types
      - [Purescript](http://www.purescript.org/) Haskell like to JS
      - [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
        - One way data binding Haskell like functional language compiles to JS, HTML and CSS 🙏
- Cool project to use Elixir outside of doing Web stuff?
  - Nerves of course, run Elixir on a RaspberryPi and do awseome stuff with embedded hardware
  - [Built with Nerves](https://nerves-project.org/)
  - Matz is nice, but Frank is nicer
  - Build something cool like [Farm Bot](https://farm.bot/)
- Object Oriented VS Functional Programming
  - It may be easier for people new to programming to learn Functional first then to learn Object Oriented
  - Learning Functional from Object Oriented you have to change your thinking more
